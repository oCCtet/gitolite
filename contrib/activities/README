The 'activities' feature for Gitolite implements a simplistic
"(recent) activities" view for a Git web browser (such as gitweb).
It consists of two parts:

 * Gitolite trigger for logging actions (repo creations and pushes)
   taken on repositories that are visible for gitweb

 * Web page HTML snippet, CGI program and javascript library to read
   the log and render it on a web page (most recent actions first)

This was done because the "last change" column in gitweb is not quite
enough; it does not tell _what_ the last action was, or _who_ did it.
