======

The 'activities' feature for Gitolite implements a simple "(recent)
activities" view for gitweb project listing page. It consists of two
parts:

 * Gitolite trigger for logging actions (repo creations and pushes)
   taken on repositories that are visible for gitweb

 * Web page HTML snippet, CGI program and javascript library to read
   the log and render it on a web page (most recent actions first)

Configuration
-------------

The gitolite trigger has one option to set in ~/.gitolite.rc
file, in the %RC section:

    ACTIVITIES_LOG_FILE  =>  '/var/log/gitolite/activities.log',

The CGI server-side program understands the following options in the
optional /etc/gitolite-activities.conf file (defaults shown below):

    # log file; sync with the gitolite activities trigger
    # configuration option ACTIVITIES_LOG_FILE
    LOG_FILE=/var/log/gitolite/activities.log

    # initial number of log entries to show
    MIN_COUNT=7

    # alternate, larger amount of log entries to show; user
    # can toggle between these two views
    MAX_COUNT=100

    # query interval for page refreshes in milliseconds
    QUERY_INTERVAL=10000
