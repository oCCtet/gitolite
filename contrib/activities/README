======

The 'activities' feature for Gitolite implements a simple "(recent)
activities" view for gitweb project listing page. It consists of two
parts:

 * Gitolite trigger for logging actions (repo creations and pushes)
   taken on repositories that are visible for gitweb

 * Web page HTML snippet, CGI program and javascript library to read
   the log and render it on a web page (most recent actions first)

Configuration
-------------

The gitolite trigger has one option to set in ~/.gitolite.rc
file, in the %RC section:

    ACTIVITIES_LOG_FILE  =>  '/var/log/gitolite/activities.log',

The CGI server-side program understands several options in the
(optional) /etc/gitolite-activities.conf file. See the example
file gitolite-activities.conf.sample for details.

JavaScript minimizer
--------------------

Google Closure Compiler service at http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home
was used to generate the activities.min.js file.
