INSTALL
=======

This document gives generic installation directives. If you're running
a Debian/Ubuntu system, see README.Debian for some specific details.

Prerequisites
-------------

The 'activities' feature for Gitolite requires the jQuery javascript
library to be accessible via the url "/javascript/jquery/jquery.js".

While no hard dependency to gitweb exists, these installation instructions
assume that gitweb is used.

Install method
--------------

If Gitolite is installed using the git repo, it is most convenient to
set up gitweb and the webserver to find the files from the repo instead
of manually copying them around.

Gitolite configuration
----------------------

Modify the .gitolite.rc configuration file:

 * enable activity logging by adding the 'activities' program into
   the ACCESS_2 and POST_CREATE trigger hashes

 * set ACTIVITIES_LOG_DIR option to contain a path to an existing log
   directory which is writable by the 'gitolite user', and readable by
   the webserver

 * set ACTIVITIES_MAX_RECORDS to indicate the amount of log entries
   to keep

Gitweb configuration
--------------------

Configure the webpart.html to be loaded by gitweb.cgi via the $home_text
gitweb configuration variable:

  # html text to include at home page
  $home_text = "/opt/gitolite/contrib/activities/webpart.html";

Nginx configuration
-------------------

Set up a location that allows the javascript library activities.js to
be accessed via url "/javascript/gl/activities.js". Same for the jQuery
library.

Set up a location for /activities that allows access to the activity logs.
The location should be an alias to where the trigger script configuration
variable ACTIVITIES_LOG_DIR points to. For example, assuming the RC file
defines

  %RC = (
      # ...
      ACTIVITIES_LOG_DIR    =>  '/var/log/gl',
      # ...
  );

Then the nginx location directive could be something like:

  location /activities {
      alias /var/log/gl;
      access_log off;
  }
